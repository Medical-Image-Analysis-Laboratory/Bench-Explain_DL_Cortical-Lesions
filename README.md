- **Cross-domain validation**: Assessment of model generalization across different clinical sites
- **Performance explanation**: Analysis of factors influencing segmentation accuracy
- **Stratified evaluation**: Balanced assessment considering lesion characteristics and site diversity

## üìÅ Repository Contents

### Preprocessing Pipeline

## üê≥ Trained Model Access

### Docker Container

The primary deliverable of this research is a containerized model for cortical lesion segmentation, available at:

**[https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/petermcgor/nnunetv2/general](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/petermcgor/nnunetv2/general)**

**Model Specifications:**
- **Architecture**: nnU-Net 3D full resolution  
- **Input**: T1-weighted MRI (MP2RAGE/MPRAGE sequences)
- **Output**: Binary cortical lesion probability maps
- **Training**: Multi-site MS cohort with stratified cross-validation
- **Validation**: Cross-domain evaluation on independent test sets

**Preprocessing Requirements for Predictions:**
The only preprocessing required for new images is skull stripping using [SynthStrip](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/docs/synthstrip/). Detailed usage instructions and examples are provided in the Docker repository's README.

## üî¨ Reproducibility

### Data Preparation

The preprocessing pipeline ensures reproducible data preparation:

1. **Multi-site integration**: Harmonized processing across clinical sites
2. **Stratified splitting**: Maintains balanced representation while preventing data leakage
3. **Quality control**: Automated exclusion of low-quality scans based on MRIQC metrics
4. **Standardization**: Consistent skull stripping and orientation across datasets

### Cross-Validation Strategy

Our stratified approach ensures:
- Subject-level grouping (no data leakage between train/test)
- Balanced site representation across folds
- Lesion characteristic stratification (count, volume, distribution)
- Domain separation (development vs. deployment datasets)

## üìä Benchmarking Results
